                      This is part 1 in a multi-part blog series, talking about
                      my journey from knowing nothing about programming, to
                      where I am now.

                        These posts aim to share some context about my career
                        and to help you get to know me. I believe anybody can be
                        a developer, and I hope this helps someone decide to
                        pursue their dream

                      First, some context: I&#x27;m a 25-year-old, straight
                      white male born and raised in the UK. I come from a
                      working-class farming family. Small farms typically
                      don&#x27;t make much money, so as a child, I didn&#x27;t
                      have much in terms of electronics. I was that kid who
                      would go over to their friend&#x27;s houses to be able to
                      play the new version of Spyro.

                      My parents got us our first computer when I was 11, a
                      second-hand Dell (one of those ugly cream-coloured boxy
                      things). My brother and I got to use the computer for a
                      couple of hours in the evenings, which I mostly spent
                      playing Runescape.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As you can probably tell, I was never averse to
                      electronics and was much more of an inside kid than an
                      outside one, which persists to this day (except the kid
                      part, mostly).

                    <p>
                      As I grew up, I became the person to fix any problems
                      which came up; mostly just broken printers and plugging in
                      monitors or routers. I&#x27;m sure a lot of you are
                      familiar with being &#x27;tech support&#x27; for your own
                      family.

                      At school, I studied IT from ages 15-18, but the majority
                      of what we learned was how to properly use Microsoft Word,
                      Powerpoint, and a bit of history about the web. We learned
                      about LANs WANs and MANs (networking), but at a
                      fundamental level, and we learned how to put data into
                      Microsoft Access, which I never used for anything
                      practical. I don&#x27;t remember anything about this
                      content now, but it was all low-level stuff.

                      For my exams across all topics, I coasted. I didn&#x27;t
                      study outside of school and managed to achieve A&#x27;s
                      and B&#x27;s at the end of Secondary School (Sophomore
                      year). This approach gave me false confidence, and I
                      coasted through 6th Form (Junior and Senior years) too,
                      which was far less successful. I passed, barely, getting
                      mostly D grades. Still, I managed to get into University
                      (College).

                      I&#x27;m still not sure exactly <strong>why</strong> I
                      went to university. I didn&#x27;t get good grades, so I
                      was going to a below-average university. I think I went
                      because I&#x27;d never planned for my future. I
                      didn&#x27;t know what career path I wanted to take, but I
                      could go to university, so I just followed the path laid
                      out for me. I was still coasting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I was most proficient with and most interested in
                      computers, so I studied Computing, the most generic
                      computer course you could take, aiming to figure out what
                      I wanted to specialise in along the way.

                      University was my first exposure to coding. I started with
                      C# and learned bits of lots of languages, including C++,
                      Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP &amp; .Net. Some of these
                      were more natural to me than others. I also got lots of
                      exposure to theory, including modules on User Experience,
                      History of Computing, User Testing, Security and probably
                      more things I&#x27;m not remembering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Web development was the most exciting thing for me, so as
                      I got closer to my final year, I specialised more in those
                      topics. By the time I was graduating, I was creating
                      (pretty bad) websites for coursework projects. I
                      wasn&#x27;t coasting any more, maybe because I&#x27;d
                      found a topic I enjoyed, but I was still struggling to
                      achieve consistently good grades.

                        Being able to score well in exams doesn&#x27;t translate
                        into being able to produce good work. No matter your
                        level or your education, putting in hard work to learn
                        what you need to grow is far more valuable than getting
                        lots of A&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t learn to pass exams. Learn
                        how to learn.

                      I graduated from university with an Upper Second class
                      degree (2:1), but only just. I scored the lowest possible
                      score I could get (not intentionally). The results of my
                      modules varied drastically, with some scoring 35%, while
                      others scored 90%+.

                      I left university with a relatively good grade, but no
                      decent projects to show off, and no practical experience
                      to my name, which led me to my struggled search for a job.

                        Good grades aren&#x27;t everything. Many jobs,
                        especially for junior roles, value practical experience
                        more. Showing off work experience and real projects are
                        incredibly valuable.

                      I may have a university degree, but I know a lot of people
                      who don&#x27;t and are better developers than I am. If you
                      don&#x27;t think university is the right path for you,
                      choose a different one. You&#x27;ll still be able to find
                      a job as employers value real experience more than grades.
