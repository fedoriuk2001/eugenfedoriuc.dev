          <div>
            <p>
              I&#39;ve always loved technology. From a young age, technology has
              interested me. Most children play video games of some kind, from
              tetris to spyro, crash bandicoot to final fantasy, I loved playing
              with computers, but my interest didn&#39;t stop just at
              entertainment.
            </p>

            <p>
              The more I played, the more I wanted to understand how things
              worked. If something broke, I would take it apart and figure out
              what had gone wrong, trying to get it back to normal.
            </p>

            <p>
              I remember taking apart my computer when I was 12, an event which
              horrified my parents.
            </p>

            <p>I still build my own computers.</p>

            <p>
              I never lost my curiosity, but my interest in technologies changed
              as I expanded my knowledge from taking apart equipment to building
              new websites in code.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now I focus on people and learning how they interact with
              websites, making sure they can achieve their goals leaving them
              satisfied and more likely to return as customers.
